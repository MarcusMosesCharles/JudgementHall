# About the Game

Undertale: Judgement Hall is a fan-made tribute to Toby Fox’s Undertale, focusing on a reimagined encounter within one of the game’s most iconic settings — the Judgement Hall. In this standalone experience, players will face a familiar yet challenging battle inspired by the spirit, mechanics, and emotional weight of the original game.

This project was created as a personal passion piece, exploring the tone, pacing, and combat style of Undertale, while introducing original twists and mechanics that make this fight uniquely my own.

Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the Underground, prepare for a test of your soul.
